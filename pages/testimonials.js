                Murtado Bustillo put together a great interpreting team at the SDIA Annual General Meeting and
                Networking Conference which was invaluable in our many meetings and workshops. Without Murtadoâ€™s team
                of simultaneous interpreters in English, Spanish and French, communication between the members of our
                international network would have been very difficult during this two-week event. As it was, things
                went really smoothly throughout. A wonderful, professional service!
