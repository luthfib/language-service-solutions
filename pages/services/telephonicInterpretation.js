									What is telephonic interpretation?
								</h4>
								<p className='no-margin-top'>
									This type of interpretation refers to, as it sounds, interpretation done over the
									phone. You simply call us and the interpreter will walk you through the simple
									process. The main difference to all other types of interpretation is that since it
									is done over the phone it reduces the need for an interpreter to be physically
									present at the time of the appointment. Saving you time and money.
								</p>
								<br />
								<h4 className='headline text-white no-margin-top small-margin-bottom upperCase'>
									Examples of common uses
								</h4>
								<p className='no-margin-top'>
									Family therapies, one-on-one meetings or sessions, follow-ups, interviews, house
									visits, conference calls with clients, parent-teacher conferences
								</p>
								<br />
								<h4 className='headline text-white no-margin-top small-margin-bottom upperCase'>
									Dependable. Confidential. Affordable.
								</h4>
								<p className='no-margin-top'>
									Our team of professional interpreters will guarantee you have a confidential and
									culturally appropriate experience throughout the process. Based in the Triangle,
									we are familiar with the locations, organizations and the community, giving us the
									local awareness and knowledge to guarantee high quality service that is relevant
									to your needs. Additionally, we can offer to dispatch an interpreter to meet you
									wherever you are should your needs change, something many other companies cannot
									offer.
