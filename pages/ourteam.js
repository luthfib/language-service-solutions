                                Indonesian and Portuguese. Her travels across
                                the globe contributed to her passion for
                                languages and research, and provided a solid
                                foundation in her understanding of and respect
                                for cultural diversity. She loves community work
                                and sees language justice work as an opportunity
                                to break down racial inequalities and improve
                                access to opportunities. Latimah enjoys cooking,
                                dancing and spending time with her family.
